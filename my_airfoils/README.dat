The airfoil input file should be as:

- Start at the leading edge
- Sweep the upper side (extrados)
- Sweep the lower side (intrados)
- Close the airfoil at the leading edge
- Do not use TAB to separate the coordinates



When reading the airfoil from an external file remember to:

- Do repaneling 
- Check chord normalization. Recommended values are between 0-1
- Check origin. Recommended value is 0 in x



Airfoil file formats
--------------------
LOAD recognizes four airfoil file formats:  Plain,  Labeled,  ISES,  MSES.
All data lines are significant with the exception of lines beginning
with "#", which are ignored.



Plain coordinate file
.....................

This contains only the X,Y coordinates, which run from the 
trailing edge, round the leading edge, back to the trailing edge 
in either direction:

X(1)  Y(1)
X(2)  Y(2)
 .     .
 .     .
X(N)  Y(N)



Labeled coordinate file
.......................

This is the same as the plain file, except that it also has an 
airfoil name string on the first line:

NACA 0012
X(1)  Y(1)
X(2)  Y(2)
 .     .

This is deemed the most convenient format to use.
The presence of the name string is automatically recognized if
it does not begin with a Fortran-readable pair of numbers.  Hence, 
"00 12 NACA Airfoil" cannot be used as a name, since the "00 12" 
will be interpreted as the first pair of coordinates.  "0012 NACA"
is OK, however.

Some Fortran implementations will also choke on airfoil names 
that begin with T or F.  These will be interpreted as logical
variables, defeating the name-detection logic.  Beginning the
name with _T or _F is a workable solution to this "feature".



Buffer airfoil normalization
----------------------------
XFOIL will normally perform all operations on an airfoil with the
same shape and location in cartesian space as the input airfoil.
However, if the normalization flag is set (toggled with the NORM 
command), the airfoil coordinates will be immediately normalized 
to unit chord and the leading edge will be placed at the origin.
